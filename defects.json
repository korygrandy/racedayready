        "resolution": "The 'Edit Event' modal was missing the multi-select dropdown for checklists, which caused the JavaScript to fail. The missing HTML element has been added. Additionally, the countdown was not refreshing on new event creation, which has been corrected by adding the appropriate function call in `schedule.js`. A UI flicker was also fixed by hiding countdown elements by default in the HTML."
