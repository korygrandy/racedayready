        "resolution": "A TypeError occurred because `garage.js` was trying to access `App.unlockedGarages` before it was initialized, and the 'unlock-garage-modal' was missing from `index.html`. The fix involved initializing `unlockedGarages` as an empty array in `main.js` and adding the required modal HTML to `index.html`."

This caused a 'Cannot read properties of null' error. The fix was to move these two event listener attachments into the `loadAdminSettings` function, which is only called after the Developer Mode view is visible, ensuring the elements exist before listeners are attached."
