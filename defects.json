        "resolution": "The backend route for the Raceday Countdown was catching an error but incorrectly returning a 500 status code. The logic has been updated to gracefully handle the error and return a successful 200 OK response with `event: null`, which the frontend can handle without crashing."

        "resolution": "The application was trying to load data for the Race Schedule page even when it wasn't visible, causing a crash. The logic was refactored to a 'lazy loading' approach, where data is only fetched when the corresponding view is activated. This resolves the errors and improves performance."
